        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Hi, my name is Kamille. Much like this humble website, I am a work in progress. My interests span from <a href="/education/cal">ancient Rome</a> to <a href="/projects/DIHTFAPSL">the externalities of the price of milk</a>. Having had a penchant for languages since I was a child and won any spelling bee thrown at me, though high school and college when I dabbled variously in Spanish, German, French, Danish, Latin, and Italian, I now find myself immersed in technical languages that allow me to bring these language skills (and others) to life in so many new ways.
        </p>
        <p>
        I learned almost all of my languages through hard work in every single level of the world-renowned California public school system (from K to B.A.), and through extensive travel (which I count among my passions). After graduating in Latin in 2015 and studying it on fellowship in Rome with <a href="http://www.paideiainstitute.org">the Paideia Institute</a>, I found myself inexplicably losing simple vocabulary. Noticing these memory issues and advocating hard for myself with doctors, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, for which surgery has only garnered a partial response. This setback forced me to put my career plans on hold in 2016, but rather than see it as a setback I recognize that it has increased my capacity for handling large situations in stride.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am currently working full-time as a junior web developer with the Cardiovascular Medicine team at the <a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/center-marfan-syndrome-related-aortic-disorders.html">Center for Marfan Syndrome and Related Aortic Disorders at Stanford University</a> where I am working <i>ab initio</i> on a proof-of-concept web application for collecting and analyzing health data related to Marfan Syndrome for research and advancement. It is an honor to be working with such a brilliant medical team and to be supporting such a dear cause.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am also a supporter/member of the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, the <a href="http://www.famsf.org">Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco</a>, and <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>.

        I live the dream with my partner and several houseplants near Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
